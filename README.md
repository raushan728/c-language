# 🚀 Learning C++

Welcome to my C++ Learning Repository!  
Here, I'm documenting my journey as I learn and practice the C++ programming language.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

I have started learning C++ to build a strong foundation in programming and understand concepts like:

- ✅ Variables & Data Types  
- ✅ Input/Output (cin, cout)  
- ✅ Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Relational)  
- ✅ Control Statements (if, else, switch)  
- ✅ Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- ✅ Functions  
- ✅ Arrays and Strings  
- 🔄 Pointers (In Progress)  
- ⏳ Structures and Unions  
- ⏳ Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
- ⏳ File Handling  
- ⏳ STL (Standard Template Library)

## 🧠 Goals

- Understand the syntax and structure of C++
- Build basic to intermediate level C++ projects
- Strengthen problem-solving and logic building
- Prepare for Data Structures & Algorithms

## 🔧 How to Run

### 📌 Requirements:
- A C++ compiler installed on your system  
  (e.g. **g++** for Linux/Windows via MinGW, or Visual Studio on Windows)

### 💻 Steps to Compile and Run

#### ▶️ Using Command Line (Windows/Linux/Mac):
1. Open terminal (or Command Prompt)
2. Navigate to the directory where your `.cpp` file is located:
```bash
   cd path/to/your/file
   ```   
3. Compile the C++ file using g++:
 ```
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename.exe
   ```  
4. Run the executable:
 ```
   ./filename.exe   # for Linux/Mac
   filename.exe     # for Windows
   ```

## 💡 Example:
```
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world.exe
./hello_world.exe
```

## 🔒 .gitignore
This repo uses .gitignore to prevent compiled .exe files from being tracked or pushed to GitHub.
```
*.exe
```

This is a personal learning space. If you're also learning C++, feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements
